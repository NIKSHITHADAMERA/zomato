# zomato Restaurant Performance Evaluation and Success Factors

Problem Statement: To identify the key factors that influence a restaurant's success and performance on the Zomato platform to provide insights for new restaurant owners or Zomato's business development team.

This project analyzes Zomato Bangalore restaurant data to identify the key factors that drive restaurant success on the platform. The goal is to help new restaurant owners and Zomato’s business team understand how location, cuisine, ratings, and digital features impact performance.

Using the Kaggle Zomato Bangalore dataset (cleaned to 2,308 restaurants), the analysis includes data cleaning, KPI creation, and exploratory analysis in Excel/Python. Missing values were removed, ratings and cost were converted to numeric, and unnecessary columns were dropped to create an analysis-ready dataset.

Key insights show that average rating is 3.48⭐ with only 10% high performers (≥4.5⭐), and locations like Whitefield, Jayanagar, and Koramangala lead in both count and rating. Digital features such as online ordering and table booking are linked to higher ratings and engagement, making them important levers for restaurant success.
